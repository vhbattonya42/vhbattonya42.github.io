    title: "About Me"
    text: "My story"
    body: "Hey there! I'm Victor, and my story is pretty wild when you think about it. I was born in Guaratingueta, Brazil back in 2002, and spent my early years soaking up Brazilian culture. When I was nine, my family decided to move to Tennessee, USA - talk about a big change!

After middle school, my family moved back to Brazil, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that the US was where I wanted to be. So at 15, I made probably the craziest decision of my life - I moved back to Tennessee on my own and got emancipated. Yeah, I know, it sounds intense, but I was determined to make it work.

I finished high school at Cleveland High School in 2020, then headed to Tennessee Tech University to study computer science. Fast forward to now, and I'm proud to say I graduated with a 3.98 GPA. Along the way, I've had some amazing internship experiences that really shaped my career path.

The journey hasn't always been easy, but every challenge has made me stronger. From buying my first house at 18 to landing internships at companies like MDI and Bayer, I've learned that hard work and determination really do pay off."
