Spend-Scope is a comprehensive financial tracking website I developed to help users analyze their spending patterns and income. Users can upload their bank statements and credit card statements, which the platform then converts to Excel format for easy organization and analysis. The application provides detailed insights into spending vs. earning patterns, helping users make informed financial decisions. Built with modern web technologies including Tailwind CSS for responsive design and clean user interface.
