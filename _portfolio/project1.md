LoLTracker is a mobile application I developed and published on the App Store specifically for League of Legends players. The app integrates with the official Riot Games API to track LP (League Points) gains and losses for professional players or friends in ranked matches. Players can monitor their progress, analyze trends, and compare performance over time. The app also provides real-time server status monitoring to check if any League of Legends systems are down. Built with comprehensive API integration, the app provides detailed tracking and analytics features to help users understand their ranking progression and competitive performance in League of Legends.
