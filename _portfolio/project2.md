In the AUTOFLYTE project, my team and I developed a predictive analytics application to forecast auto sales using AI and Machine Learning techniques. Leveraging proprietary data, I engineered a multi-dimensional forecasting model, integrated with a frontend that presents insightful metrics through interactive charts and maps, utilizing Highcharts and MapBox. We implemented secure authentication using Spring/JWT for Bearer authentication and designed the backend with a focus on microservices architecture, containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose. The application supports dynamic market analysis through a user-friendly interface, enabling customized market insights based on historical data and predictive models. The entire solution emphasizes scalable, maintainable code and leverages Python for data analysis, encapsulated within Docker containers to ensure a seamless deployment and operational experience.
